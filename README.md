# Portfolio Website With QT/QML/C++

This is a portfolio website created using QML/Qt/C++ and deployed via WebAssembly. 
A year ago I had a an idea of building my website with C++, but I didn't know how. I didn't know about Qt or any tools, just the basics of C++. A year later, today,
I completed the 1st verison of the site. 
Here is the link to the preview of the work, before being deployed **Open link**;



## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work across various devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **PDF Resume Viewer**: A feature that allows visitors to view and download my resume in PDF format.

- **Interactive UI**: The use of QML enables a rich and interactive user interface, providing an engaging experience for users.
