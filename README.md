# Portfolio Website With QT/QML/C++

This is a portfolio website created using QML/Qt/C++ and deployed via WebAssembly. 
A year ago I had a an idea of building my website with C++, but I didn't know how. I didn't know about Qt or any tools, just the basics of C++. A year later, today,
I completed the 1st verison of the site. 
Here is the link to the preview of the work, before being deployed;
